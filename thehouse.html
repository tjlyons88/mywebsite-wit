                <h4>about the house</h4>
                <p>Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70 and construction was completed in 1971. The building is an example of the Late Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form concrete.

                    The complex comprises a number of components: the main building with its east and south wings, the separate north wing or pavilion, the pool and the rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape in plan, and with the north wing it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the pool is located. The main building is of three storeys with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner, the north wing is of two storeys, and the carpark is two storeyed.</p>

                <p>Churchill House displays several key features of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style as follows.

                    - Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.
                    - Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.
                    In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style.
                    - Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings.
                    - Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.
                    - Precast fins for sun protection, as above.
                    - Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</p>
